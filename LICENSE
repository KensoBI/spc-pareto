LICENSE AGREEMENT AND MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT
This KensoBI Agreement, including all referenced and included Service Orders (the “Agreement”), is between Kenso Software, LLC (“Kenso Software”) and the purchaser or user of Kenso Software software and services who accepts the terms of this Agreement (“Client”). The effective date of this Agreement (“Effective Date”) is the date that Client signs or accepts this Agreement or the date mutually agreed upon by Client and Kenso Software.

Scope of Agreement
1.1 Framework.
This Agreement establishes a framework that will enable Kenso Software to provide Software and Services to Client. “Software” means KensoBI and other software programs branded by Kenso Software, its Affiliates and/or third parties including all modifications, additions or further enhancements delivered by Kenso Software. The specific services (the “Services”) and/or Software that Kenso Software will provide to Client will be described in an Order Form, signed by the parties or otherwise accepted by Kenso Software, which may consist of (a) one or more mutually agreed order forms, statements of work, work orders or similar transaction documents, or (b) an order placed by Client through Kenso Software’s website. The parties agree that the terms of this Agreement will govern all purchases and use by Client of Software and Services unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.

Obligation of the Parties
2.1 On-Site Obligations.
If Kenso Software personnel are working on Client’s premises (a) Client will provide a safe and secure working environment for Kenso Software personnel, and (b) Kenso Software will comply with all reasonable workplace safety and security standards and policies, applicable to Client’s employees, of which Kenso Software is notified in writing by Client in advance.

2.2 Changes to Work and Delays.
Changes to the Services will be made only through a written change order signed by both parties. In the event that (a) Client fails to timely fulfill its obligations under an Order Form, and this failure adversely impacts the provision of Services, or (b) events outside of either party’s reasonable control cause a delay in or otherwise affect Kenso Software’s ability to perform its obligations under an Order Form, Kenso Software will be entitled to appropriate relief, including adjusting the timing of its delivery of applicable Services.

2.3 Assistance.
Client may provide Kenso Software access to Client information, systems, and software (“Client Information”), and resources such as workspace, network access, and telephone connections as reasonably required by Kenso Software in order to provide the Services. Client understands and agrees that (a) the completeness, accuracy of, and extent of access to, any Client Information provided to Kenso Software may affect Kenso Software’s ability to provide Services, and (b) if reasonable access to Client Information is not provided, Kenso Software will be relieved from providing any Services dependent upon such access. Client will obtain any third party consents necessary to grant Kenso Software access to the Client Information that is subject to the proprietary rights of, or controlled by, any third party, or which is subject to any other form of restriction upon disclosure.

Payment
3.1 Fees and Expenses.
Fees for the Services (the “Fees”) will be identified in an Order Form and are (a) due upon Kenso Software’s acceptance of an Order Form or, for renewal of Services, at the start of the renewal term, and (b) payable in accordance with Section 3.2. Fees are stated in United States Dollars or Polish Złoty, must be paid in United States Dollars or Polish Złoty, and, unless otherwise specified in writing, do not include out-of- pocket expenses or shipping costs. Client will reimburse Kenso Software for all reasonable expenses Kenso Software incurs in connection with the performance of Services.

3.2 Invoices
3.2.1 If Client desires credit terms with respect to the payment of Fees, Client will reasonably cooperate with Kenso Software in establishing and periodically re-confirming Client’s credit-worthiness. If credit terms are provided to Client, Kenso Software will invoice Client for the Fees upon Kenso Software’s acceptance of the applicable Order Form and upon acceptance of any future order. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all payments made by Client pursuant to this Agreement are non- refundable. Kenso Software reserves the right to suspend or cancel performance of all or part of the Services and/or change its credit terms if actual payment has not been received within 10 days of the agreed upon due date.

3.2.2 If Client is paying by credit card, Client (a) authorizes Kenso Software to charge Client’s credit card for the Services and for the amount due at the time of renewal of Subscription Services, and (b) agrees to provide updated credit card information to Kenso Software for renewal purposes.

3.3 Taxes.
All Fees are exclusive of Taxes. Client will pay Kenso Software an amount equal to any Taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement or an applicable Order Form which are paid by or are payable by Kenso Software. “Taxes” means any form of sales, use, value added or other form of taxation and any fines, penalties, surcharges or interest, but excluding any taxes based solely on the net income of Kenso Software. If Client is required to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to Kenso Software, Client will increase the sum payable to Kenso Software by the amount necessary so that Kenso Software receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had Client made no withholdings or deductions.
